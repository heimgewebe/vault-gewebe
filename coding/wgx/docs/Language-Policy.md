# Language Policy

This repository uses English as the primary language for all newly written user-facing
text, documentation, and code comments. Older material may still be written in German,
but contributors should prefer English when adding or updating content.

## Guidelines

- **English dialect**: Prefer US English (e.g., "summarize" instead of "summarise").
- **Commands and CLI output**: Prefer English messaging. If existing commands output
  German text, you may keep it when unrelated to your change. When touching the
  surrounding code, migrate the relevant messages to English.
- **Documentation**: Write new documentation in English. If you update a German
  document, consider providing an English translation or summarizing the changes in
  English.
- **Commit messages and PRs**: Default to English unless the entire conversation for
  the change happens in another language and all stakeholders agree.

## Rationale

Adopting English as the default lowers the barrier for contributors who do not speak
German and keeps the project aligned with tooling defaults. Maintaining this policy
makes language expectations explicit and discoverable for everyone working on the
repository.
