# Piper TTS voices

Download the required Piper voice packages (`.onnx` + `.json`) and place them
in per-voice folders under this directory:

```
models/
  piper/
    en-gb-sarah/
      en-gb-sarah.onnx
      en-gb-sarah.onnx.json
```

The voice assets are intentionally excluded from Git. This README ensures the
directory tree exists and documents the expected structure for local installs.
