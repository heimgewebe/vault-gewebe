# LLaMA family models

Place your local `gguf` weights inside this directory. The runtime expects the
following structure:

```
models/
  llama/
    <model-name>/
      model.gguf
```

Keep model files out of version control. This placeholder file documents the
expected layout so the directory exists in a fresh checkout.
