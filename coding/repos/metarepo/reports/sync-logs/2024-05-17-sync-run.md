# Sync Attempt Log — 2024-05-17

## Context
- Operator: Codex agent @ container `901720d8dcec`
- Repo scope: `repos.yml` (static include: weltgewebe, hauski-audio, semantah, wgx, hauski)
- Branch context: `work`
- Git: git version 2.43.0 | rsync: rsync  version 3.2.7  protocol version 31 | gh: n/a (not installed)
- Network: Outbound HTTPS blocked by upstream proxy (APT + GitHub fetch → 403 Forbidden)
- Proxy configured: none (system lacks credentials)

## Steps
1. Prereq check: **failed partially** — `gh` CLI missing; attempted `apt-get install gh` aborted because proxy returned `403 Forbidden`. Confirmed `rsync` available and `git` v2.43.0 present.
2. Fleet listing: **succeeded via fallback** — parsed `repos.yml` directly to enumerate weltgewebe, hauski-audio, semantah, wgx, hauski.
3. Template validation: **succeeded** — fallback checks verified presence of `.wgx/profile.yml`, `reusable-ci`, and `wgx-guard` templates.
4. Sync dry-run: **failed** — `./scripts/sync-templates.sh --repos-from repos.yml --dry-run` aborted on first clone because HTTPS access to GitHub was denied (proxy credentials missing).

## Blockers
- `gh` executable absent, preventing workflow triggers or branch protection adjustments.
- HTTPS egress restricted: both APT and `git clone` operations receive proxy-mediated `403 Forbidden` responses.

## Next Actions
- Restore outbound HTTPS connectivity or provide proxy credentials for APT and GitHub.
- Install the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and authenticate before retrying fleet tasks.
- Re-run the sync script (optionally with `--dry-run`) once network access is functional.
- Consider bundling `gh` binaries and mirrored repositories inside the devcontainer to remove external dependencies during maintenance runs.
